Guidelines
==========

We care about commit quality. Please first ensure that you follow the [commit message rules](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/PROJ/Rules+for+Commit+Messages) before sending a PR.

The full [GDP Contribution Process](https://at.projects.genivi.org/wiki/display/GDP/GDP+Contribution+Process) explains more about when to create a PR, JIRA ticket and what to expect in the processing of the PR (updates, rebases, etc.)
